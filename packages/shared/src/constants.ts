 * and "the caller has nothing stored to exclude" -- either way, the worker is available for every
 * shift, per the new semantics. A row that exists always carries a non-empty subset (the schema
 * never stores/represents an empty one — see `schema.prisma`'s `WorkerAvailability` doc comment),
 * so `excludedShifts: []` is not a distinct case this function needs to special-case.
